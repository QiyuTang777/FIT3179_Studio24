        <h2>- Overview -</h2>
        <p>
            Each of us lives on the same earth, so changes in the population of different countries will have a certain impact on other countries, 
            especially those with large populations.
        <br>
        <br>
            Today in 2022, many countries have begun to care about the problems that may arise from population growth issues, 
            such as environmental pollution, food shortages, and gender issues, <strong>most of which are likely to related to the country's demographic characteristics</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(216, 89, 4);">
            This visualization will focus on the different dimensions of the population of countries in the world today.
            <br>

    <div id = "Outer">
        <h2>- Population -</h2>
        <div id = "world_map"></div>
        <p>
            Through this visual population map, China currently ranks first in population.
            Most of the most populous countries are located in East Asia, South Asia, and Indonesia.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Overall, Asian countries account for a relatively high proportion of the world's population.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "Outer">
        <h2>- Growth Rate -</h2>
        <div id = "growth_rate"></div>
        <p>
            From a growth rate perspective, the most obvious of these are the two population superpowers, India and China.
            Although both countries have populations of more than one billion, India's population growth rate is still higher than China's.
            This may bring more demographic benefits to India in the future, but it also needs to bear the burden of population.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two more special points are <strong>Moldova and Ukraine</strong> : Although located in Europe, Moldova is still a developing country and the second poorest country in Europe. 
            The relatively backward economy and national culture may be the reason why Moldova's population growth rate is so high.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ukraine, on the other hand, is undergoing war, and the high population outflow for many years has made Ukraine's population growth rate relatively low.
            <br>

    <div id = "Outer">
        <h2>- Density -</h2>
        <div id = "density"></div>
        <p>
            By sorting through countries of different rankings, 
            we found that among the top five countries in terms of population, 
            India has a significantly higher population density than the rest.
            Also a large country with a population of more than one billion, 
            India's population density is nearly three times that of China.
            <br>
            <br>
            When the ranking became the top ten countries by population, 
            Bangladesh surpassed India to become the country with the highest population density.
            This 147,570 square kilometers of land carries about 168 million people, and the population density is nearly three times that of neighboring India. 
            The population density is too high and the per capita GDP is less than 1,700 US dollars.

    <div id = "Outer">
        <h2>- Trend of Female Percentage -</h2>
        <div id = "female_percentage"></div>
        <p>
            By looking at the percentage of female population in the top ten countries by population in the world over the years, 
            we found that the percentage of female population in most countries increased after 1960.
            There are also countries, such as Indonesia, where the percentage of female population has dropped by one percentage point, 
            which may be related to historical events in these countries through the time observed in the chart.
